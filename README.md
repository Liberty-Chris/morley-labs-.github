# **Morley** ‚Äì A Ladder Logic Based Language for Smart Contracts on Cardano

**ArkWriter is evolving. Things will break. There is much work to do.**

**Morley** is a domain-specific language (DSL) that brings **Ladder Logic programming** to **Cardano Smart Contracts**, enabling automation engineers, industrial programmers, and IoT developers to build **blockchain-powered automation** with ease.

By compiling Ladder Logic into **Plutus Core**, **Morley** simplifies smart contract development for those familiar with **PLC programming**, **embedded systems**, and **industrial automation**.

## **Why Morley?**
- **Industry-Friendly** ‚Äì Designed for engineers in **IoT, manufacturing, and automation**.
- **Faster Development** ‚Äì Write Cardano smart contracts in an intuitive Ladder Logic syntax.
- **Blockchain Integration** ‚Äì Secure, verifiable transactions on Cardano.
- **Transparency & Auditability** ‚Äì Track machine states, events, and industrial processes.
- **Efficient & Lightweight** ‚Äì Optimized for **on-chain execution**.

## **Use Cases**
**Morley** enables **trustless** and **automated** decision-making in industries such as:
- **Industrial Automation** ‚Äì Log sensor data, trigger smart actions on the blockchain.
- **Supply Chain & Logistics** ‚Äì Track inventory and automate contractual agreements.
- **Energy Management** ‚Äì Secure monitoring of power grids and resource allocation.
- **Aerospace & Automotive** ‚Äì Machine error tracking, predictive maintenance, and quality assurance.
- **IoT & Embedded Systems** ‚Äì Secure communication between connected devices.
- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)** ‚Äì Machine-driven DeFi actions (e.g., automatic staking or lending).

## **Project Components**
| Component                 | Description                                     |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **LadderCore**            | Intermediate representation (IR) for Ladder Logic |
| **LL-Parser**             | Parses Ladder Logic into IR                    |
| **PlutusLadder Compiler** | Compiles IR into Plutus Core                   |
| **PlutusLadderSim**       | Simulates Ladder Logic in a blockchain environment |

## **Getting Started**
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Installation
(to be continued)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Example Smart Contract
A **Ladder Logic-based Smart Contract** that tracks an **inventory system** on **Cardano**:

```
(* Define Inputs and Outputs *)
X1   --[ ]----------------( )-- Counter1 (* Item scanned in inventory *)
X2   --[ ]----------------( )-- Counter2 (* Item removed from inventory *)

(* Trigger a blockchain event when threshold is reached *)
Counter1 == 100  --[ ]--( )-- TX_Send(* Mint new tokens when inventory is full *)
Counter2 == 0    --[ ]--( )-- TX_Send(* Burn tokens when inventory is empty *)

(* Implement a reset condition *)
Reset --[ ]--( )-- Counter1 (* Reset inventory counter *)
Reset --[ ]--( )-- Counter2 (* Reset removed items counter *)
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Compile to Plutus Core
To compile the smart contract to Plutus Core, run the following command:

```bash
morley compile contract.ll
```

## üé® Morley GUI - ArkWriter
The **Morley GUI** is a simple interface for building Ladder Logic-based smart contracts. Designed with usability and clarity in mind, the GUI simplifies complex workflows without overwhelming the user. Extended functionality is in progress.
